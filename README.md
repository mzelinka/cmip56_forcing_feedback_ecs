# cmip56_forcing_feedback_ecs
Tables containing effective climate sensitivity (ECS), effective 2xCO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing (ERF<sub>2x</sub>), and radiative feedbacks for CMIP5 and CMIP6 models.  Methdology is described in [Zelinka et al., GRL (2020)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL085782), but the table is regularly updated as new CMIP6 models are published.
