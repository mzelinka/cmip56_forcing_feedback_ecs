# cmip56_forcing_feedback_ecs
Tables are provided containing effective climate sensitivity (ECS), effective 2xCO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing (ERF<sub>2x</sub>), and radiative feedbacks for all CMIP5 and CMIP6 models that have published output from abrupt CO<sub>2</sub> quadrupling experiments. Also provided is a figure showing Gregory plots for the CMIP6 models. Methdology is described in [Zelinka et al., GRL (2020)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL085782), but the CMIP6 results are regularly updated as new models are published.
