# Summary
Tables are provided containing effective climate sensitivity, effective 2xCO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing, and radiative feedbacks for all CMIP5 and CMIP6 models that have published output from abrupt CO<sub>2</sub> quadrupling experiments. Also provided is a figure showing Gregory plots for the CMIP6 models. Methdology is described in [Zelinka et al. (2020)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL085782), but the CMIP6 results are regularly updated as new models are published.

## Table Contents
For each model, the following global mean values are provided:

| Abbreviation  | Description  |
| ------------- |-------------|
| ECS       | effective climate sensitivity |
| ERF2x     | 2xCO<sub>2</sub> effective radiative forcing |      
| PL        | Planck feedback |
| PL*        | constant-RH Planck feedback |
| LR        | lapse rate feedback |
| LR*        | constant-RH lapse rate feedback |
| WV        | water vapor feedback |
| RH        | relative humidity feedback |
| ALB        | surface albedo feedback |
| CLD        | net cloud feedback |
| SWCLD        | shortwave cloud feedback |
| LWCLD        | longwave cloud feedback |
| NET        | net feedback |
| ERR        | kernel residual feedback |

The final two rows provide the multi-model average and standard deviation. Note that PL + LR + WV is equivalent to PL* + LR* + RH, and that CLD = SWCLD + LWCLD.
